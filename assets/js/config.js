    /* A Stripe Payment Link — https://buy.stripe.com/…

       Leave it empty and Purchase falls back to the demonstration
       drawer, so an unconfigured checkout can never present a broken
       button. Paste the link and the button goes straight to Stripe:
       no cart, no account, no page of our own in between.

       In the Payment Link's own settings, four things matter:

         · Wallets — Apple Pay, Google Pay and Link switched on. This
           is the whole of the "twenty seconds" claim: a returning
           iPhone buyer pays with a double-click and never types.
         · Receipts — on. Stripe's own receipt email IS the order
           confirmation; there is no server here to send one.
         · After payment — redirect to
             <siteUrl>/thanks.html?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
           That page is what fires the Purchase conversion for the ad
           platforms. Without the redirect the ads cannot be optimised.
         · Adjustable quantity — on. It replaces the stepper that used
           to sit next to the button. */

       exists (Stripe is the source of truth) and it upgrades on its own
       to "No. 041 of 500". Never set this from anything that counts up
